            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Octopus (plural octopuses) relates to approximately 300 species of soft-bodied, eight-limbed molluscs of the order
                Octopoda. The order is grouped within the class Cephalopoda with squids, cuttlefish, and
                nautiloids. Like other cephalopods, an octopus is bilaterally symmetric with two eyes and a beak, with its mouth at
                the
                center point of the eight limbs. The soft body can rapidly alter its shape, enabling octopuses to squeeze through
                small gaps. They trail their eight appendages behind them as they swim. The siphon is used both for respiration and
                for
                locomotion, by expelling a jet of water. Octopuses have a complex nervous system and excellent sight, and are among
                the
                most intelligent and behaviourally diverse of all invertebrates.</p>

                <h3>Octopus Habitats</h3>
            
                <p>Octopuses inhabit various regions of the ocean, including coral reefs, pelagic waters, and the seabed; some live in
                the
                intertidal zone and others at abyssal depths. Most species grow quickly, mature early, and are short-lived. In most
                species, the male uses a specially adapted arm to deliver a bundle of sperm directly into the female's mantle
                cavity,
                after which he becomes senescent and dies, while the female deposits fertilised eggs in a den and cares for them
                until
                they hatch, after which she also dies. Strategies to defend themselves against predators include the expulsion of
                ink,
                the use of camouflage and threat displays, the ability to jet quickly through the water and hide, and even deceit.
                All
                octopuses are venomous, but only the blue-ringed octopuses are known to be deadly to humans. </p>

            <h3>Octopus In Mythology</h3>
            <p>Octopuses appear in mythology as sea monsters like the Kraken of Norway and the Akkorokamui of the Ainu, and probably
            the Gorgon of ancient Greece. Octopuses appear in Japanese erotic art, shunga. They are eaten and considered a
            delicacy by humans in many parts of the world, especially the Mediterranean and the Asian seas.</p>
